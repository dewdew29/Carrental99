# Carrental99
A Car rental management system made by me and my teammates as a part of our College Coursework.
It has features like Car Booking by customer and acceptance/rejection by the Admin. There is a separate login panel for Admin. 
Admin can handle all car details, customer details, booking details etc. 
Built using Php, HTML and CSS. For database, I have used MySQL.
To run this, you will need Xampp Server installed in your computer. After installing, open it and start the "Apache" and "MySQL" server. Now go to C:\xampp\htdocs\
and create a folder named "carrental". Inside the folder, paste all these files.

Now go to your browser and type this in the URL -> localhost/phpmyadmin Click on "New", 
create a database named "carrental" and click create. Now here import the "carrental.sql" file.
Now type this in the URL -> localhost/carrental

There you Go!
